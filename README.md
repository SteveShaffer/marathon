A batch-runner for JavaScript calls

...I think.  For now, I'm writing this because I'd like to make batch calls against JSON APIs and process the responses.

## TODOs

Saved runner list locations (like API query definitions)
Saved runner lists (and importing capabilities)
Saved tracks

(All should be file-saveable?)
